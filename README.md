## ✨ What is redux-simplify?

**redux-simplify** is a lightweight collection of hooks that simplifies working with Redux state in React.  
It provides ergonomic and modern alternatives to `useSelector` and `useDispatch`, allowing you to:

- Select deeply nested state using dot notation.
- Read and write Redux state like React’s `useState()`.
- Bind Redux actions easily with hooks.
- Select multiple state slices at once.

✅ Fully type-safe  
✅ Compatible with **React 16.8+** (Hooks onward)  
✅ Compatible with **Redux Toolkit**  
✅ Supports React 17, 18, 19+

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ `useRedux()`

Read nested state using dot-path notation:

```typescript
import { useRedux } from 'redux-simplify';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useRedux('user.profile.name');

  return <div>Hello, {state}</div>;
};
```

### 2️⃣ `useReduxMulti()`

Select multiple state paths at once:

```typescript
import { useReduxMulti } from 'redux-simplify';

const { state } = useReduxMulti(['user.profile.name', 'counter.value']);

console.log(state['user.profile.name']);
console.log(state['counter.value']);
```

### 3️⃣ `useReduxState()`

Read & write Redux state like React's `useState`:

```typescript
import { useReduxState } from 'redux-simplify';
import { counterSlice } from './counterSlice';

const [count, setCount] = useReduxState('counter.value', counterSlice.actions.setCounter);

setCount(42);
```

### 4️⃣ `useBoundAction()`

Bind Redux actions to dispatch automatically:

```typescript
import { useBoundAction } from 'redux-simplify';
import { counterSlice } from './counterSlice';

const incrementByAmount = useBoundAction(counterSlice.actions.incrementByAmount);

incrementByAmount(5); // dispatches action
```

## 💡 Motivation

Redux can be powerful but verbose — **redux-simplify** aims to make Redux feel as simple as React's `useState()` without sacrificing its robustness.
